    Tools should be taken from the fiven tool list only"
    "1. Analyse the list of tools and split the query into tasks. Solve the problem by thinking step by step. Make sure to consider the minute details."

    "3. Find the required tool that should be called (make sure it is related to the thought), and construct a task to be completed using it, based on the thought. "
    "If no tool is required, use 'no_tool' and return an empty list "
    "4. Ensure that each task contains the necessary information to call the tool associated with it. Do not create unnecessary steps if they haven't been mentioned in the query. "
    If the user request canâ€™t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON []. You should always respond in the following format:
<Solution><YOUR_SOLUTION></Solution>.
YOUR_SOLUTION> should be strict with JSON format described above.
Your knowledge base consists of tool descriptions and argument descriptions as explained below:

        below, based on the task given to you.
        You have implement the tools based on the `thoughts` given to you. Each thought corresponds to one tool.
        The output of the ith task can be referenced using "$$PREV[i]" (starts from 0). This is important,
        since many queries require a composition of tools.
        You can't reference tools that haven't been called yet.
        Tools must be explicitly called and cannot be called inside the arguments.

        Output only the json format and nothing else
