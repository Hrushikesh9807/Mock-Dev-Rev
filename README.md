# Mock-Dev-Rev
Follow the instructions to run our code - 
1. Download the 'main.py', 'helper.py', and 'prompts.py' files.
2. Enter your API mistral key in the main.py file.
3. use 'streamlit run main.py' in the terminal.
4. It will ask you to upload the toolset and give the query.

Optional - 
While using the code on a new toolset a query-solution pair needs to be generated and validated by a human. Run the 'Example_Datagen.py' and make the suitable changes to include the new examples in both prompts for a better solution.

Precautions - 
The code might sometimes give a JSONDecode error.

Kindly contact 9823965807 - Hrushikesh Kant for any queries in the code as well as errors while running the code.
